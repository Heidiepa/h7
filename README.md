If the article is long (more than 4 pages), you can skim it for this task and base your summary on skimming.
Summarize contents, not meta. If you have to do this, note in writing that this is based on skimming.
Wrong: The article talks about the dangers of cyber criminals in Fobaristan. They go into great details of crimes. There is even a surprising fact!
